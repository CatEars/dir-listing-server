# dir-listing

A webserver built (mainly for myself) for serving a fancier directory
listing together with the capacity to download files from it.

The urge to create this came from using nginx for autoindexing
files. If you've used this you know it works really well, but it
creates something that looks rather bad and is not superfriendly for a
human to navigate. The goal of dir-listing is to create a local
webserver which does the same thing as autoindex in nginx, but also
makes it quite navigable and looks a bit better than just plain HTML.
